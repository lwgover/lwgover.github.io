        <p class="lead mb-5">I am a recent graduate from the University of Puget Sound, with a double major in Computer Science and Politics & Government. I am very passionate about both majors and particularly their intersection. As I worked with teams throughout college, I demonstrated my leadership abilities by representing my university in competitive programming competitions and by teaching as a TA, Tutor, and Lead Instructor. On top of that, I have explored my interests further by publishing research papers in both fields – Politics and Artificial Intelligence. These experiences have contributed to a deepened curiosity and deepened my passion for both disciplines. I am excited to bring this same energy to professional work environments and help others do the same.</p>
