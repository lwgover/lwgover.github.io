I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to generate movie recommendations based on similarity scores. I created an efficient interface that allowed users to gain insights into the graph, navigating the similarities between movies. As part of this project, I wrote a visual representation of the graph with D3.js, which was designed to give users a visual understanding of the movie relationships.",

It is created using Phong Shading which gives it a more natural, realistic look. The orbits of the planets are represented around the sun, with the planets constantly spinning as they travel along their trajectories. The Solar Body textures, lighting, and size are described by the given .sol file, which can easily be varied. ",
